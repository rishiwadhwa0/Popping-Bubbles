-Looking into some libraries that can recognize pitch. I tried using an Aubio example project that I found online on this forum: https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/pitch-detection/3807/2 but there are some build errors.

-I have ditched my previous idea of pitch detection since I have found a more interesting project idea to work on which requires the of sound library and shapes. I have followed a youtube tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiTsE7P-GDs, on audio visualization, which I have got to work on my own laptop. I experimented with things such as only displaying the shape with large beats (not the tiny ones) since I only want the large beats for my game.

-As for the clicking potion of my game, I experiemented with clicking circles and changing the color each time the circle is pressed within it's area. I imagine creating circle objects for my game with their center x and y values as fields.
